    "__Ans)__ Statistics is the science of collecting,organizing and analyzing data.It involves the use of mathematical and statistical methods to extract meaningful insights from data, which can be used to inform decisions, make predictions, and test hypotheses.In essence, statistics helps us make sense of the data that we collect and provides a way to understand the world around us in a more quantitative and objective way."

    "* __Descriptive statistics:__ Descriptive statistics involves the methods used to summarize and describe the main features of a data set. This includes measures such as the mean, median, mode, standard deviation, and range. Descriptive statistics can be used to provide an overview of a data set and identify patterns or trends within it. For example, descriptive statistics can be used to summarize the average income, age, or education level of a particular population.\n",

    "* __Inferential statistics:__ Inferential statistics involves using statistical methods to make inferences about a population based on a sample of data. This includes methods such as hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and regression analysis. Inferential statistics can be used to test hypotheses, make predictions, and estimate parameters of interest for a population based on a sample. For example, inferential statistics can be used to determine whether a new medication is effective in treating a particular disease, or to estimate the proportion of a population that supports a particular political candidate.\n",

    "* __Ordinal data:__ Ordinal data is data that has a natural order or ranking. However, the differences between the values cannot be determined. Examples of ordinal data include rank order in a competition (1st, 2nd, 3rd place), star ratings (1 star, 2 stars, 3 stars, etc.), or level of education (elementary school, high school, college, etc.).\n",

    "* __Interval data:__ Interval data is data that has a natural order or ranking, and the differences between the values are meaningful. However, there is no true zero point. Examples of interval data include temperature in Celsius or Fahrenheit (0 degrees is not an absence of temperature), or time of day (12:00 PM is not an absence of time).\n",

    "__For example,__ if a researcher is analyzing data on the favorite colors of individuals in a survey, and the data is at the nominal level of measurement, then it would not be appropriate to calculate the mean or median, as these are measures of central tendency that require numerical values. Instead, the appropriate measure of central tendency would be the mode, which is the most frequently occurring value. However, if the data were at the ratio level of measurement, such as income, then calculating the mean or median would be appropriate and informative.\n",

    "\n",
    "* __Nominal data__ is the lowest level of measurement and refers to data that can be categorized into mutually exclusive groups or categories with no inherent order or ranking. For example, gender (male/female), political affiliation (Democrat/Republican/Independent), or hair color (blonde/brunette/redhead) are all examples of nominal data. Nominal data can be summarized using frequencies and percentages, and statistical analysis can be performed using measures such as chi-square test.\n",
    "\n",
    "* __Ordinal data,__ on the other hand, involves the ranking of data in a specific order or hierarchy, but with no measurable differences between the data points. For example, education level (elementary school, high school, bachelor's degree, master's degree, PhD), level of agreement (strongly agree, agree, neutral, disagree, strongly disagree), or customer satisfaction ratings (very satisfied, satisfied, neutral, dissatisfied, very dissatisfied) are examples of ordinal data.

    "\n",
    "__Ans)__ A __box plot or a box and whisker plot is a commonly used plot to display data in terms of range.__ A box plot provides a graphical representation of the five-number summary of a dataset, including the minimum value, first quartile (Q1), median (second quartile or Q2), third quartile (Q3), and maximum value. The box in the plot represents the middle 50% of the data, with the bottom of the box representing the first quartile and the top of the box representing the third quartile. The whiskers extending from the box indicate the range of the data, with the minimum value represented by the lower whisker and the maximum value represented by the upper whisker.\n",

    "Box plots are useful for comparing the range and distribution of data between different groups or categories, identifying outliers and skewness, and detecting differences in central tendency and variability. They are particularly useful when dealing with large datasets or datasets with many variables, as they provide a concise and informative visual summary of the data."

Inferential statistics are often used in research to test hypotheses and make predictions about populations based on a sample.\n",
